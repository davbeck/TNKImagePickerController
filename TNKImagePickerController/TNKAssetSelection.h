 When the user taps on an asset, or takes a photo or does anything to select assets, this will be called to verify the new selection. You can return `assets` unchanged, modified, or an empty array to block selection entirely.
 
 Use this method for things like limiting the number of selected assets. You can perform aditional actions to let the user know why they can't select more photos, or unselect older assets.
